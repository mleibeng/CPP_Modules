# CPP_Modules

---

Meant as an introduction to C++ these modules introduced the basic concepts of object-oriented programming to me.

The topics ranged from the basic syntax of C++, over to operator overloads, stringstreams, classes, orthodox canonical form, Fixed-point numbers, Inheritance, polymorphism, pointer management, templates, try-catch blocks and exception throws, to container functionalities, such as find, replace, and sort algorithms.
